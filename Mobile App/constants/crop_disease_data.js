        description : 'Early blight is primarily a disease of stressed or senescing plants. Symptoms appear first on the oldest foliage. Affected leaves develop circular to angular dark brown lesions 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3–4 mm) in diameter. Concentric rings often form in lesions to produce characteristic target-board effect.',

        cure : 'For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.',

        fertilizerRecommendation : "There are many different fungicides that can be used to control early blight. These products contain chemicals like azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, difenoconazole, boscalid, chlorothalonil, fenamidone, maneb, mancozeb, trifloxystrobin, and ziram. It is a good idea to rotate between different chemical compounds."

        description : 'Late blight of potato is identified by blackish/brown lesions on leaves and stems (Figures 3,4) that may be small at first and appear water-soaked or have chlorotic borders but expand rapidly and the entire leaf becomes become necrotic.',

        cure : 'Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important.',

        fertilizerRecommendation :'Generally, in reducing the severity of late blight disease and improving potato tuber yield, the combined application of calcium nitrate with calcium chloride or the application of calcium nitrate alone was found to be more efficient than the application of calcium chloride alone.'

            description : 'Two rust diseases of corn occur in Nebraska and in other temperate areas. Common rust of corn occurs every year to some extent, and is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The other rust disease, southern rust, is caused by Puccinia polysora and occurs less frequently in Nebraska.',
    
            cure : 'The best management practice is to use resistant corn hybrids. Fungicides can also be beneficial, especially if applied early when few pustules have appeared on the leaves.',
    
            fertilizerRecommendation :'Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease.'

            description : 'The disease first appears in the form of small, necrotic spots with halos. These usually expand to become rectangular lesions, about 1/8 inch wide by up to 2 inches to 3 inches long and gray to brown in appearance.',
    
            cure : 'Reducing the thatch layer, using correct fertilizer and mowing at the proper height can greatly reduce the chance of gray leaf spot occurring. Additionally, irrigating the lawn deeply but infrequently can prevent continuous leaf wetness, the ideal environment for gray leaf spot.',
    
            fertilizerRecommendation :'During the growing season, foliar fungicides can be used to manage gray leaf spot outbreaks. Farmers must consider the cost of the application and market value of their corn before determining if fungicides will be an economical solution to GLS.'

            description : 'Typical symptoms of northern corn leaf blight are canoe-shaped lesions 1 inch to 6 inches long. The lesions are initially bordered by gray-green margins. They eventually turn tan colored and may contain dark areas of fungal sporulation.',
    
            cure : 'Measures for controlling and preventing blights typically involve the destruction of the infected plant parts; use of disease-free seed or stock and resistant varieties; crop rotation; pruning and spacing of plants for better air circulation; controlling pests that carry the fungus from plant to plant;',
    
            fertilizerRecommendation :"With northern corn leaf blight, you can't get away with just a V5 application, she says. V5 and R1 applications may be prudent when very susceptible hybrids are planted, but that's on very susceptible hybrids only.oliar diseases also can spur the development of stalk rots later in the season."

                description : 'Brown spot is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.',
        
                cure : 'Use fungicides (e.g., iprodione, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and carbendazim) as seed treatments. Treat seeds with hot water (53−54°C) for 10−12 minutes before planting, to control primary infection at the seedling stage.',
        
                fertilizerRecommendation :'Significant control of brown spot has been achieved using silicon fertilizers. The use of a mixture of cattle manure and chemical fertilizers somewhat also reduces its severity. High humidity (86-100%), prolonged periods of leaf moisture and high temperatures (16-36°C) are very favorable for the fungi.'

                description : 'The rice blast fungus may infect and produce lesions on most of the shoot but usually not the leaf sheath. From the seedling stage through plant maturity, rice blast progresses through several phases starting with leaf blast, followed by collar, panicle and node blast.',
        
                cure : 'Seed treatment at 2.0 g/kg seed with Captan or Carbendazim or Thiram or Tricyclazole. Systemic fungicides such as pyroquilon and tricyclazole are possible chemicals for controlling the disease. Spraying of Tricyclazole at 1g/lit of water or Edifenphos at 1 ml/lit of water or Carbendazim at 1.0 gm/lit.',

From the seedling stage through plant maturity, rice blast progresses through several phases starting with leaf blast, followed by collar, panicle and node blast.',
        
                cure : 'Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further. Systemic fungicides like triazoles and strobilurins can be used judiciously for control to control blast.',
        
                fertilizerRecommendation :'Seed over a range of time to spread the heading dates. However, avoid planting late because blast will be more severe. Seed to a stand of 15 to 20 plants per square foot. Avoid excessive nitrogen application rates and apply no more than 30 pounds per acre of nitrogen per application at midseason.'

                description : 'Leaf rust is a relatively easy disease to diagnose as it forms orange-brown pustules that are raised above the leaf surface. These pustules can be rubbed off the leaf leaving an orange-brown mark on the finger.',
        
                cure : 'Brown rust affects both wheat and barley. However, exploitation of varietal disease resistance, adoption of cultural control techniques and timely treatment of crops with fungicides all help to reduce disease pressure. Note: Also known as leaf rust.',
        
                fertilizerRecommendation :'Effective brown rust control comes from a programmed approach to minimise any early season inoculum and from protectant sprays, since the disease is very difficult to eradicate once established in the crop. At T2, when brown rust is most evident, aim to spray at GS37-39 or when the flag leaf is just fully emerged.'

                cure : 'Yellow rust control is best started at T0 with a fast moving rust azole such as tebuconazole. This can then be followed with Proline275 or Aviator235Xpro at T1 and Aviator235Xpro or AscraXpro at T2, depending on timeliness and Septoria pressure at the point of application.',
