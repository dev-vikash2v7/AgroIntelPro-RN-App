Rice images were collected from the datasets:
1. Dhan-Shomadhan: A Dataset of Rice Leaf Disease Classification for Bangladeshi Local Rice [2]. 
The images from the Leaf background images of the classes Brown Spot and Rice Blast was added to the classes Rice___Brown_Spot and Rice___Leaf_Blast to increase the number of training samples. This dataset has the license CC BY 4.0 [3]. The images were not changed or edited.
2. "Rice Leafs" dataset from Kaggle [4]. 
The images of this dataset was added to the classes Rice___Brown_Spot, Rice___Healthy, and Rice___Leaf_Blast.
