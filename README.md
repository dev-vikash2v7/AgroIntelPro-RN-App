## 1.1 🧐 About The Project <a name = "about"></a>
<b>AgroIntel Pro</b> is a <b>Smart Farming Mobile Application</b> is a cutting-edge approach to farming that leverages technology to optimize crop production while conserving resources. This project report discusses the development and implementation of a Smart Crop, Fertilizer, and Disease Predictor System. The system employs data analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields, recommend appropriate fertilizers, and detect and predict diseases in crops. The objective of this project is to enhance agricultural productivity, reduce resource wastage, and provide timely solutions to common farming challenges

Here is the app in action.

## 1.2 🧐 Features <a name = "features"></a>

### 1. Disease Prediction

- **Description**: This feature allows users to predict diseases in crops by analyzing images of affected leaves.
- **How It Works**: Users can take a photo of a diseased leaf and submit it for analysis. The application will use machine learning to identify the disease and offer recommendations for treatment.
- **Benefits**: Early disease detection can help prevent the spread and minimize crop damage.

### 2. Best Crop Recommendation

- **Description**: Users can get recommendations for the best crops to plant based on their location, soil type, and other factors.
- **How It Works**: The app takes user inputs and uses algorithms to suggest suitable crop options. It considers factors like climate, soil quality, and the farmer's preferences.
- **Benefits**: Helps users maximize crop yield and income.

### 3. Fertilizer Recommendation

- **Description**: The application provides personalized fertilizer recommendations to improve soil health.
- **How It Works**: Users input soil test results, and the app suggests the right type and quantity of fertilizer.
- **Benefits**: Efficient fertilizer use leads to healthier crops and reduced environmental impact.

### 4. Farm Community

- **Description**: Connect with other farmers, share experiences, and seek advice.
- **Features**: Discussion forums, chat, and sharing of farming tips.
- **Benefits**: Collaboration and knowledge sharing among farmers.

### 5. Farm Store

- **Description**: Users can browse and purchase farming equipment, seeds, and other agricultural products.
- **Features**: Product listings, reviews, and secure payment.
- **Benefits**: Convenient access to farming supplies.

### 6. Authentication System

- **Description**: Secure user authentication and account management.
- **Features**: Registration, login, and profile management.
- **Benefits**: Protects user data and provides a personalized experience.

## 🧐 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

## Installation

Note : To get started with the AgroIntel Pro app development, you'll need to install Expo, which is a powerful toolchain for building and developing React Native applications.


To run this application on your local development environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).


1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-vikash2v7/AgroIntelPro-RN-App.git


>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run  your React Native App. :partying_face:
